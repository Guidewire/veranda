Veranda
=======

  A Docker deployment, management, and monitoring project for a very small clusters (low double-digit count).
  Consists of a Master that tracks Agents (slaves) and sends Docker deployment requests via the Docker Remote API.
  Slaves can be heterogenous and can even be "real" VMs, such as those running in an OpenStack environment.
